## About us

**La Legiun Straniera** was born as a holiday home in **2015**, after the complete renovation of an old tavern managed by our grandparents until **1971**.

The name “**La Legiun Straniera**” comes from a curious post-war anecdote, linked to our territory and family.

We are **Oscar and Patrizia**, and we look forward to welcoming you to discover the beauty of our valleys in a cozy, independent house equipped with every comfort.
